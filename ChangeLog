02-09-2016: Fix warnings with ffmpeg version 3.1.3: use codecpar - minimum set initialised, probably needs more work. NOTE that if you initialise the stream with a codec (as previously done) the new codecpar stuff seems to be ignored. Remove h264 annex B filter as this has been depreciated in ffmpeg, but can't find any replacement.

15-11-2016: Preliminary support for vp8. Problem with vorbis audio in webm. However vp8->x264 seems to work. Requires:
            start_file=start_x.elf
            fixup_file=fixup_x.dat
            in /boot/config.txt
16-11-2016: Problem with vorbis audio appeared to be frame size: this requires extra data to calculate. Sure enough, extradata is filled in in codecpar for vorbis input streams. If present on the audio input stream, copy extradata to the audio output stream. Works now!
15-01-2017: Changed main loop, added in extradata handeling for h264 input streams, added in OMX_IndexParamNalStreamFormat stuff.
22-01-2017: After update of firmware to raspberrypi-firmware 20170114-1 (arch linux), sps and pps are now output together in a single buffer at the start; previously they appeared in separate buffers. Fix this by using OMX_BUFFERFLAG_CODECCONFIG test similar to ffmpeg omx code.
            Use _Atomic variables in OMX callbacks instead of mutex. However, decoder still uses mutex locking: the way the buffers are set up means that it depends on a structure defined in OMX headers. To use atomic variables, the buffer allocation would need to be changed, e.g. use an array of pointers to the buffers instead. Then an atomic int variable could be used to indicate a free buffer by passing back the index.
20-04-2017: More trouble with pts/dts/duration: looks like there can be more than 1 frame per packet returned from ffmpeg. In that case, each frame in that packet gets the same time stamp and the video suffers from stuttering. Work-around: forget the time stamps and just make some up! Removed most of the code but kept the omx ticks. Just base each frame duration at the encoder output on frames per second. Note that the fps from omx is not always correct and sometimes zero - use container supplied fps from ffmpeg input context. Ideally, the proper duration should be used when available, otherwise interpolate using the frame rate. Then at least we would be using the input information as much as possible! This has not been implemented though, current time stamps are made up.
21-04-2017: Make up the output PTS based on the input frame duration. Added some stats to show if the pts is drifting away from the omx tick (pts delta). This should either be zero, or oscillate about zero - it should not constantly increase or decrease.
22-04-2017: The made-up pts didn't work properly with certain webm files... add -p option to revert to using dts, but only if it increases the output pts. If not, fall back to duration. Applies to audio too - problem with file was audio duration, dts was OK.
16-06-2018: Remove line 391: case AV_CODEC_ID_MPEG2VIDEO_XVMC: Not in ffmpeg v4.0
            Remove av_register_all() This has been deprecated and is no longer required.
            Remove ic->filename; deprecated, no longer in input context. Replaced with ctx->iname.
24-08-2018: Add mapProfile(), mapLevel(), mapColour(). These used to be hard coded (in makeOutputContext()) mappings between OMX and ffmpeg. In configure() removed setting decoder output port colour profile to zero, added get parameter for level.
            Also had a play with min and max quantisation levels: shows promise for higher quality encoding of e.g. low contrast films. Code added at the end of configure() but doesn't do anything yet (set to defaults).
            Might also want to check out OMX_IndexParamBrcmVideoInitialQuant and OMX_IndexParamBrcmVideoRCSliceDQuant.
23-09-2018: Add in quantisation command line options and test: for low contrast film limit qmax to 30 or so (default is 50) and increase bit rate.
29-09-2018: Check interlace type and set detected type if -d is used, some minor bug fixes & cleanup.
30-09-2018: Fix timings again - set fps at decoder setup from container retrieved average fps. OMX ticks seems OK, so use these.
            Note: fps setting is used internally to calculate bit rates, it's not just simply propagated through the pipeline.
                  Some interlaced content uses one frame per field, av libs report as 50fps. However, decoder seems to internally merge these so the actual output fps is 25fps. For these, should use de-interlacer outputting 1 frame per field, however this is not implemented
                  at the moment and for this material the pts is OK, but fps is incorrect.
04-10-2018: Did some tests with various frame rate video: it seems that either the decoder or encoder is detecting the fps, must be from either set pts or picked up from the raw video stream itself. Set the framerate as detected by omx, rather than ffmpeg! Maybe need an option to use ffmpeg detected frame rate?
05-10-2018: Add option to output one field per frame for interlaced content.
12-10-2018: Found a bug in using getopt(): if -d was specified without an option it screwed up. Couldn't get optarg() to return an error if no option was specified. Couldn't get it to do proper posix behaviour. Gave up and ended up writing my own command line parser: Note that filename arguments are different now, input file must come first, output file specified by -o option. Other bug corrections and cleanup: If input file not found, just abort imediately - before, encoder / decoder pipeline was still initialised.
13-01-2019: Added in ability to select output container format and tidy up output. Send all output to stderr (this is what ffmpeg does) so that output file can be specified as /dev/stdout.
10-01-2020: Fixed bug with option make up pts: account for any difference in timing between audio and video streams.
            Start looking at other rate control related options: move bitrate control to configureBitRate(). Went through rpi docs and headers, and omx manual, and made notes: OMX_rate_control_parameters.odt
11-01-2020: Added different rate control options; estimate average bit rate on info line during encode.
12-01-2020: Tested various available OMX option to try and improve quality on some noisy videos, nothing made a huge difference so keep with defaults. Tests are in configureTestOpts(), but commented out. This is called after configureBitRate().
