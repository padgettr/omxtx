Is it worth using more than 1 encoder buffer?
* No - the slowest component is the encoder, so adding extra output buffers won't help. If output media was slow, it might be worth having two buffers so that whilst one was being written another could be getting filled. However, transcoding a DVD to H264 2Mb/s typically runs about 4X realtime, i.e. about 8Mb/s or 1MB/s which doesn't require speed - a USB stick will do just fine. To test this, try transcoding to ram disk - about the fastest IO you can do on the PI - the frame rate is similar.

What is 'encoder time'?
* This is the rough time in seconds that the output buffer was empty (i.e. nothing to do) during the empty encoder buffer loop. Numbers close to zero would indicate a fast encode, which would probably benefit from more encoder buffers and a separate thread for the encoder buffer empty. Does not include time taken writing output file to disk; however this is generally very small compared to the encode time. Really only any use during development.

What is 'pts delta'?
* This is the difference between pts (picture time stamps) derived from the input, and actual pts recorded in the output file.

Why won't vp8 / mjpeg decode work?
* start_file=start_x.elf
  fixup_file=fixup_x.dat
  is required in /boot/config.txt. Note that these are not hardware decoders, they are built into the firmware as software decoders running on the gpu, so expect little cpu usage.

My input is 50fps interlaced, but the output is only 25fps with or without the deinterlacer.
* It seems that some files are encoded such that ffmpeg detects them as 50 fps, but this is really 50 fields per seconds, two fields making up one frame. The omx decoder detects the frame rate, wich will be half in this case. By default, the de-interlacer is set to output one frame for the two interlaced fields. This can be changed by passing the -d0 option, increasing the output to 50fps deinterlaced.
 
How is bit rate calculated on the info line?
* This is an estimate based on the average frame size in bits * frame rate
  Doesn't include the audio stream.

Why is there no contant bit rate (CBR) mode?
* This is only supported on the PI for h264 baseline profiles - this code uses the default high profile, so CBR is not available.
